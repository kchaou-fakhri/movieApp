# Description


Movie App with React Native and OMDb API
This React Native movie app integrates with the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API to provide users with a seamless experience for searching and viewing movie details. Key features include:

Search Functionality: Users can search for movies by title, utilizing the OMDb API to fetch relevant movie data.
Movie Details: Detailed information about each movie, including the title, year, genre, director, actors, plot summary, and poster image.
Favorites: Users can save their favorite movies for quick access.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean, responsive design ensuring smooth navigation and interaction on both iOS and Android devices.
This app leverages the power of React Native to offer a cross-platform mobile experience, with real-time data from the OMDb API ensuring users have the most up-to-date information about their favorite films.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
